# Hello there!

Hi my name is **Joakim Nylén** and I develop various things.
Mainly in **Elixir** and **Ruby**.

Currently I work at [Kollegorna](https://kollegorna.se) where I do magic behind the scenes.

I also run a company named **Pixelmonster OÜ** (based in Estonia) that owns [XMLTV.se](https://xmltv.se), [Honeybee.it](https://honeybee.it) and [Metagraph](https://metagraph.wiki).
